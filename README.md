# Twilytics Analytics

This project was developed for the course "Data Engineering Project - Building real time data pipelines" by [Prof. Dr. David Klotz](mailto:david.klotz@hdm-stuttgart.de?subject=[GitHub]Twilytics) of the Stuttgart Media University by [Alexander Stahl](mailto:as291@hdm-stuttgart.de?subject=[GitHub]Twilytics) and [Johannes Ströbele](mailto:js349@hdm-stuttgart.de?subject=[GitHub]Twilytics).

Subscriptions (e.g. Netflix, Spotify) can be managed using FoxSub. Each user can add, edit, and delet its subscriptions. Further, users have a dashboard which shows their monthly subscription costs and a profile where they can edit their cost goal.
