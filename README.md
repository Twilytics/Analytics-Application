# Twilytics Analytics

This project was developed for the course "Data Engineering Project - Building real time data pipelines" of [Prof. Dr. David Klotz](mailto:david.klotz@hdm-stuttgart.de?subject=[GitHub]Twilytics) at the Stuttgart Media University. The data pipeline was developed by [Alexander Stahl](mailto:as291@hdm-stuttgart.de?subject=[GitHub]Twilytics) and [Johannes Ströbele](mailto:js349@hdm-stuttgart.de?subject=[GitHub]Twilytics).

The Twilytics dashboard provides insights into the trends on Twitter based on real time data. Users can get informations, for example, about how trends change on Twitter in a respective city or how the trends between cities correlate. For this samll university project, the cities Stuttgart and Berlin were analyzed.
